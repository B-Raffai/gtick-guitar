GTick TODO List
===============

* sub beats
* start actual beat at time of setting speed (?)
* save settings periodically, also on every profile saved
* set to defaults
* test suite
* valgrind run

Further ideas:
* Bugs:
  - Sounds correct (all platforms)?
* start gtick in running state
* not only normal and accentuated tick, but one of the following:
  - third state for each tick: off
  - list of sounds (built-in, sound files) for each tick to choose from
* Java version for cellular phones like Siemens C55 or Sony-Ericsson t610
* GLADE integration
* Implement PC Speaker output
* Feedback: Playing statistics (std. deviation, ...)
* Info: Sample rate, device, ...

* generalize gtick (library?) for:
  - GTK standalone mode (currently)
  - console mode (interactive, record to file, ...)
  - XMMS plugin
  
* ALSA support
* JACK support
